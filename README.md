KAPPA (Kinda Asymmetrical and Pretty Paradoxical Adventure) is an asymmetrical local pvp/coop/multiplayer gamemode that allows the second player to control any NPC.

Controllable enemies have their regular capabilities unchanged: jumping, flying, shooting, clawing, biting, wand casting and throwing are all possible. The system should be capable of working perfectly fine on any custom map but might have some incompatibilities with more-or-less advanced enemies. Now features a multiplayer mode: up to 4 extra player-like entities can be summoned and controlled concurrently. Pick up temple hearts to respawn the fallen ones.

[M-Nee](https://github.com/re-coilless/mnee) is absolutely required.
